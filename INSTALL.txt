# How to install Greenland


- Use the following invocation to install into your python environment:

    pip install .

- Use the following invocation to install locally:

    make dev-install

  This will create a virtual environment and a "live" installation of
  Greenland. The environment can be pulled into your shell with

    . ./env.sh

  ( You're on your own if you use a shell that is not Bourne Shell
    compatible. The author of these lines doesn't feel the urge to
    support abominations like the c-shellor any of its spawn.)

  Quite probably this will not work at once: The author has not
  invested much in dependency management yet.
